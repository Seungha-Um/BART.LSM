# Particle MCMC for agent-based SIS model

This repository contains code to implement the methodology described in the paper "â€™A Bayesian Approach to Estimate Causal Peer Influence Accounting for Latent Network Homophil", by Um, Sweet and Adhikari (2025)

This package uses the primary functions from [`SoftBART`](https://github.com/theodds/SoftBART) and the primary functions from [`HLSM`](https://github.com/cran/HLSM) to incorporate the SoftBART model and HLSM model as components.

# Installation

The packages can be installed with the `devtools` package:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(devtools) 
devtools::install_github(repo='Seungha-Um/BART.LSM') 
```

The package with the vignettes can be installed with 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github(repo='Seungha-Um/BART.LSM', build_vignettes = TRUE) 
```

and then accessed by running `browseVignettes("BART.LSM")`. Alternatively, vignettes are available at [Simulation](https://rpubs.com/sheom0808/981711)


Alternatively, 
vignettes are available at [Simulation](https://rpubs.com/sheom0808/946709) and [real data](https://rpubs.com/sheom0808/926959).

One of the vignettes replicates our analysis of the advice-seeking network dataset, including a noisy subset, while the other demonstrates our methods using simulated data.
