# BART_LSM model to estimate the average causal peer influence. 

This repository contains code to implement the methodology described in the paper "â€™A Bayesian Approach to Estimate Causal Peer Influence Accounting for Latent Network Homophil", by Um, Sweet and Adhikari (2025)

This package uses the primary functions from [`SoftBART`](https://github.com/theodds/SoftBART) and  [`HLSM`](https://github.com/cran/HLSM) to incorporate the SoftBART model and HLSM model as components.

# Installation

The packages can be installed with the `devtools` package:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(devtools) 
devtools::install_github(repo='Seungha-Um/BART.LSM') 
```

The package with the vignettes can be installed with 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github(repo='Seungha-Um/BART.LSM', build_vignettes = TRUE) 
```

<!-- and then accessed by running `browseVignettes("BART.LSM")`. Alternatively, vignette is available at [Simulation](https://rpubs.com/sheom0808/981711) -->


<!-- Alternatively,  -->

<!-- The vignette illustrates our methods using simulated data, while this repository provides the advice-seeking network real dataset, along with a noisy subset. -->
